I'm Tyler Chambers. I really enjoy Bitcoin and bitcoin adjacent tech. I spend a lot of time thinking about wallets, L2s, and on-chain privacy.

Sometimes I write software. I really like TypeScript, Rust, and Go. When I'm not writing software, I'm hanging out with my dog or sleeping.

Here's where you can ~~harass~~ find me online:

- Email: me at tylerchambers dot net
- Twitter: [@nottylerchamb](https://twitter.com/nottylerchamb)
- Github: [@tylerchambers](https://github.com/tylerchambers)
