I'm Tyler Chambers.

I spend a lot of time thinking about distributed systems, security, and making software fast.

I work on bitcoin for a living, but am very interested in the web3 and cryptocurrency space as a whole.

I really like TypeScript, Rust, and Go.

When I'm not writing software, I'm hanging out with my dog or sleeping.

Here's where you can find me online:

- Email: me at tylerchambers dot net
- Twitter: [@tylerxchambers](https://twitter.com/tylerxchambers)
- Github: [@tylerchambers](https://github.com/tylerchambers)

Are you an anonymous benefactor looking to send me money?
